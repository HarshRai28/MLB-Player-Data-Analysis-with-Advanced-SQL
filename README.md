# MLB Data Analysis Project with Advanced SQL

## About this project

This project takes a deep dive into the history of Major League Baseball (MLB) using a rich dataset of player information. As a data analyst for MLB, I used advanced SQL queries in MySQL to explore decades of player statistics, from the colleges that produce the most professional players to the spending habits of teams on player salaries.

The main questions I answered are:
- Which schools are the "MLB factories"?
- How much do teams really spend on their stars?
- What does a player's journey through the league look like?
- How do the physical attributes of players compare across different eras?

This analysis reveals fascinating trends over time and across different teams, offering a unique, data-driven look at America's favorite pastime.
